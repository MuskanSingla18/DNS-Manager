/**
* A versioned custom software source OCID (softwareSourceId)
* is required when promoting software source content to
* lifecycle stage rank one. Software source content must be
* promoted to lifecycle stage rank one before being
* eligible for promotion to subsequent lifecycle stages,
* else an error is returned. Software source content is
* expected to be promoted in order starting with
* lifecycle stage rank one, followed by rank two, then rank
* three and so on.
* <p>
When promoting software source content to lifecycle stage
* rank two, three, four or five, softwareSourceId is optional.
* If a softwareSourceId is provided for a lifecycle stage
* between two and five, the system validates that the
* softwareSourceId is already promoted to the previous lifecycle stage.
* If the softwareSourceId from the previous lifecycle stage
* does not match the provided softwareSourceId an error returns.
* If a softwareSourceId is not provided for a lifecycle stage
* between two and five, the system promotes the
* softwareSourceId from the previous lifecycle stage. If the
* previous lifecycle stage has no SourceSource content
* an error returns.
